## HTML.

 1. Use bootstrap.
 2. Create easily readable code.
 3. Include multiple HTML files.

## .CSS stylesheet planing.

 1. Try out multiple style sheets (coz why not)
 2. Used a reset.css (not self made but open license and github details are linked in the file.)
 3. Include one of each element we covered this week.

## File structure.

 1. List item

## Future improvments.

1. I deviated from the original wire-frame and didn't include a background for the main panel, in a future revision id love to add a scrolling effect that used an wave shape background.
2. The original shape I wanted for the works panel didn't snap well to mobile and I ended up using margins a bit too much, in a future revision ill ad a grid to give it more structure.
