                    <p> Banana Finder is the result of our first group project. Working with my class mates we wanted to create an application that solved the problem of ear worms, a song or lyric that gets stuck in your head but you cant remember the full song. <br> This application uses Chart Lyrics API to search Users lyrics and return results that contain those Lyrics.<br>
                    <br> The technical elements I was responsible for in this project included the UI/UX components of the site, creating the style guides, giving stater code for the basic javaScript functionality and acting as a technical support guide to trouble shoot a range of issues from branching to console debugging. </p>

                    <hr>
                    <p> REvamp was a group project that I was lucky enough to project manage, we focused on empowering our users to build, repair and improve everyday things in there lives. We used a combination of NPM packages to build the server side of this app including express.js and sequelize to manage our routes, handlebars to compile the templates and nodemailer to send confirmation emails when a user submits tips to the database. <br> This project was made to be shareable and future developments would focus heavily around social media integration. Eventually merit points would be acquired by users, adding permissions to their user account, allowing them to approve new submissions and post comments on current projects. Projects would also have a rudimentary voting system allowing us to display first, projects that have gained a lot of attention.  </p>
